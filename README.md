# Sports Celebrity Image Classifier  

This repository contains an image classifier for sports celebrities, built using **OpenCV**, **PyWavelets**, and **Logistic Regression**. The project extracts image features, processes them efficiently, and uses a robust classification model to identify sports personalities with high accuracy.  

# Features  
- **Image Preprocessing:**  
  - Uses OpenCV to load, resize, and preprocess images for feature extraction.  
- **Feature Extraction:**  
  - Leverages PyWavelets to extract key features from image data, reducing noise and improving classifier performance.  
- **Classification:**  
  - Implements Logistic Regression for simplicity and effective classification.  
- **Accuracy:**  
  - Achieves good performance of 92% for test data in distinguishing between different sports personalities.
